### Description
Plunge into an engaging prequel to the events of the TES4:Shivering Isles expansion as the world shivers with Whispers of Jyggalag. The familiar sights of sewers and Thieves Guild operatives quickly unravel as you find yourself caught between two opposing forces while traversing the deepest parts of Vvardenfell.

* Plunge into an engaging prequel to the events of the TES4: Shivering Isles expansion as the world shivers with Whispers of Jyggalag.
* Explore over 40 brand new cells: four of them massive in scope and also including a town-sized faction base.
* Immerse yourself in the lore, culture, and world-building of the mod through over 5000+ words of dialogue and 6000+ words of notes and books.
* Navigate through the sewers of Suran, descend into the depths of a mysteriously abandoned mine, uncovering that which even Daedric princes chose to conceal.
* Roam the now interconnected underworld of Suran with a sprawling sewer system, Temple catacombs, Thieves Guild base, and basement areas for many buildings in Suran.
* Delve into meticulously crafted areas with over 200+ new meshes including a brand new tile set which evokes the Daedric style with Order imposed upon it.
* Make a choice that will ripple across the boundaries of the realms through more than 10 Quests while working with the mysterious Order and the Thieves Guild.
* Fully experience the Cult of Order with custom robes and armor crafted specifically for this mod and inspired by the TES4: Shivering Isles concept art.
* Work with a Thieves Guild faction which specializes in hunting for valuable artifacts as you complete 4 new quests in the environs surrounding Suran.
* Find yourself caught between two opposing forces as you traverse the deepest parts of Vvardenfell and even into the realms of Oblivion.
* Learn more about the Logic Magic practiced by the Order as you deal with paradox traps, interact with the powerful Axiom Engine, and observe the Order's scientific studies throughout their base.
* Test your puzzle-solving skills on a haunting trip to Suran's catacombs. See how stealthy can you be while acquiring the shattered reflection of a fabled artifact that can change the course of history.
* Raid a tomb protected by illusions and see the rift where alteration and conjuration magic fold space between realms.
* Encounter the juxtaposition of decay and rebirth as you witness the decay of Order and the cult of a dead god preparing for his rebirth.
