## Important Locations
### Sewers:
* Thieves Guild Base
* Catacombs
* Desele's Cellar
* Slavemarket Cellar
### Saturan
### Inanius Egg Mine
### Sanctuary of Order
* **Library of Order:** Filled with meticulously organized tomes and scrolls. The books contain knowledge related to logic, mathematics, and the Order's philosophy. Includes the Archive of Predictions which is a room filled with scrolls containing the predictions made using the Enchanted Equation. These predictions are meticulously recorded and reviewed for accuracy.
* **Hall of Equations:** This grand hall is the heart of the sanctuary, adorned with intricate equations and symbols representing the principles of logic and balance. It's where the Harbingers gather to discuss their research and meditate on the nature of order.
* **Room of Crystal Reflection:** This chamber is filled with reflective crystal formations that symbolize self-reflection and the importance of introspection in maintaining inner order.
* **Chamber of the Chronoform:** A room dedicated to the study of time and its role in maintaining order. It contains a massive hourglass and a celestial clock that measures the passage of time with absolute precision.
* **Hall of Honored Harbingers:** A gallery showcasing portraits of the most revered members of the School of Order throughout its history. Which apparently didn't all happen below Suran - implying that the sanctuary's location may be transient.
* **Dormitories:** Living quarters for the Harbingers, characterized by impeccable organization and minimalistic design. Each room is a study in simplicity and order.
### Deep Caverns of Suran
* **Pools of Unstarlight:** Used in HoO Quest 3.

## Thieves Guild
*Located in the sewers beneath Suran. This relatively fledgling cell of thieves is looking to expand their operations and make an infamous name for themselves. The nearby Cammona Tong operations are a threat. The thieves guild should have a set of quests that build up to the Jyggalag heist through the new cells added by this mod along with some side quests which establish their connection to the vanilla city.*
### Quest 1: Establish route for "goods" through either Saturan or Inanius Egg Mine
If the bandits or queen are dead, then skip any dialogue. The player leaves a secret mark on the door of the appropriate dungeon. If they're not dead, you may bargain with the bandit leader or pacify the kwama.
### Quest 2: Loot the Suran catacombs
Client wants something from the catacombs beneath the Temple. Go through a puzzle to gain access and the item.
### Quest 3 Part 1: Sneak into the Jyggalag lair
The player will inevitably be caught since they know they're coming. This is how the player is introduced to the faction.
### Quest 3 Part 2: Steal the Chronicles
After returning to the TG, the player is tasked with stealing the Chronicles. The Chronicles are apparently used to predict the future.
### Side Quest 1: Infiltrate the Guard Tower
The guards have some incriminating evidence against one of the TG members. The player must get through a locked door in the basement of the guard tower to recover it and replace it with a harmless note.
### Side Quest 2: Goldyn Opportunity
The pawnbroker has acquired a shipment of valuable goods. You're tasked with stealing them.

## Harbingers of Order
*Located deep beneath Suran, silver crystals spread from the sanctuary of the Harbingers of Order (hoo) into the surrounding caves. This has caught the notice of the local TG who have found a way into the shrine. The hoo study and harness the power of absolute order and logic. The former can be used to prevent decay by forcing constant order upon the very foundational components of their bodies and their immediate surroundings. Potentially an offshoot of Restoration which also restores order to a broken body. The sanctuary is pristine and symmetrical.*
### Quest 1: The Paradoxical Puzzle
The Harbingers are befuddled by a paradoxical riddle which is an affront to their infallible logic. They ask the player to solve it and thereby save them from their existential crisis. They refuse to say it out loud and instead hand the player piece of parchment with this written on it: "I am something that exists only when I am not, and I am nothing when I am. What am I?". The answer is "Tomorrow". The harbingers thank the player. If the player gets it wrong, that cultist will be permanently frozen in place - stuck in their own paradox.
### Quest 2: Restoration of the Ruins
An area on the fringe of the Harbingers sanctuary has fallen into chaos (i.e. overgrown). Their logic is confusing, but they say they cannot fix it themselves and risk exposure to the disorder. They give the player a magical item which can impose order on the area. Once the player uses the item, a lush area is replaced with crystals of order and bare stone.
### Quest 3: The Enchanted Equation
The Harbingers of Order have developed a complex, enchanted equation that can predict the future and know the logical location of anything in the world through its perfect logic. The player must gather the necessary components and perform the equation to demonstrate its power and potential. The ritual requires three dregs from water touched by unstarlight which can penetrate the deepest caverns beneath Suran. These dregs are used to produce to magical chalk to scribe the equation. After writing out the equation, the cultists interpret it as locating an item hidden somewhere in Vvardenfell. They dismiss it as a useless outcome of the equation. The thieves guild thinks otherwise (potential extra quest to go somewhere far from Suran to find something).
